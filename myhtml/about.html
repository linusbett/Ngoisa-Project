<h1>ABOUT ST PETER'S SEC. NGOISA/HISTORY</h1>

<p>St. Peters Secondary school – Ngoisa is a mixed day  school located about 30 km North of Eldoret town along Ziwa - Kachibora -  Kitale tarmac road. The school was started in 2002 and has since grown into  double streams. This year&rsquo;s enrolment is 235 students (113 boys + 122 girls) we  expect 122 form one students this year. The school has often taken a few  students to Universities and colleges over the years. Last year we had 68 candidates  and 4 are joining university and the rest qualified to join other institutions  of higher learning. The school sits on a 10 acre on land title No Soy/Kapsang  Block 7(Ngoisa) 107.</p>
<p>There are 13 teachers (6 male and 7 female) employed  by the government and an additional six teachers (3 male and 3 female) employed  and paid by the school board of management. We also have 13 (8 male and 5  female) members of the non – teaching staff who assist in various ways. The  school has a bright future especially in academics but has a number of  challenges that hinder it from achieving its goals:<br />
  i) Poor fee payment by  students due to their needy back grounds.<br />
  ii) Insufficient learning  facilities like library, laboratory etc<br />
  iii) Insufficient  boarding facilities for the many needy students who need boarding<br />
  iv) More modern computers  for computer lab<br />
  v) A reliable source of  clean water<br />
  v) A school vehicle to  facilitate movement of students<br />
  Despite the above challenges, the school enjoys the  overwhelming support from members of the board of management, unwavering  commitment by the teachers and non teaching staff members, good will from the  sponsoring Catholic Church and local community. The school is situated in a  conducive environment that favors learning and is very easily accessed by a  tarmac road barely 200 meters away. </p>
